Here, we have a variable named ErrorHelper that is assigned to what is known as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). If we removed the body of this IIFE function, we would be left with the following:

```js
var ErrorHelper = (function () { ... })(); 
```

Here, we can see the simplified version of an IIFE.

The ErrorHelper IIFE returns an object that has two functions:

- The first is named containsErrors and takes a single parameter named response. The response parameter is checked by this code to see if it has any errors. We will not go through the logic of this function at this stage but rather will focus on the usage of this function a little later.

- The second function is named trace and also has a single parameter named msg. This function logs a message to the console, which includes information found in the msg parameter.

The code then checks the return value from the containsErrors function of the ErrorHelper class, passing in each of our message objects. In each case, the trace function is then called, as each of these if statements will return true.

When we run the code, we can see that:

- The containsError function returns true for the failureMessage object, and the trace function logs the errorMessage value to the console.

- The same behavior is seen for the failureMessageString object.

- The containsError function returns false for the successMessage object and, therefore, logs the value passed in as the msg argument to the console.
